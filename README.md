# NeuroScholAR

Combining ancient memory techniques with modern AR and neurofeedback technologies.

## 🎯 Project Goal
NeuroScholAR is a learning system using AR glasses and EEG headbands. The solution displays virtual notes in space and anchors them to specific locations (memory palace mnemonic technique) while automatically detecting focus drops and adapting learning sessions.

## 🏗 Architecture
The project consists of:
- **Unity App** - AR visualization, EEG processing, local ML model
- **Go Backend** - REST API, user management, data synchronization
- **Python ML Service** - Cognitive state classification, knowledge verification
- **Web Dashboard** - Progress tracking, statistics, palace management
